## Analysis

### Where is the data and How do I produce it ?

We have two data types: raw (.dat) and ROOT (.root) version  
Depending on the data taking location our raw and root files are stored in different folders.  
At the moment we are taking data in Gif++, we are using the machine in the preparation area.  
You can access the machine (acqcmsmu01) via ssh: ssh acqcms@128.141.151.164  

Raw files are stored in this direcotry: /data/gifOctober/raw/  
Since there is no root installed at the moment in this machine we use the computer in beam dump area. 
You can access this computer via : ssh acqcmsmu@PCLINUX-LYOCMS03     

If you don't have the root file for necessary run in LYOCMS03 machine in directory /data/gifOctober/roottrees/, please produce it.
After you decide which one to run.  
Production:  
1 ) login to LYOCMS03 machine.
2 ) If you want to work on Scan ID 508 for example, you need to copy raw files from LYOCMS01 to 03:  
scp acqcms@128.141.151.164://data/gifOctober/raw/*SN_508* /data/gifOctober/raw/  
3 ) Converting raw file to ROOT file   
```
cd /home/acqcmsmu/FEB_DAQ/Analysis/AnalyseFEBV2  
souorce init.sh
```
Edit the produce.sh for example change the Scan ID (variable y) , or change the MAx Trigger Value (Variable z).
```
sh produce.sh
```

### How do I produce DQM plots ?  

Let's say you want to check dqm plots HV point 1 , Scan ID 508 and with 1000 Max Trigger:
```
cd /home/acqcmsmu/FEB_DAQ/Analysis/AnalysisiRPC/
source init.sh
root -l 'dqm_beamdump.C(1,508,1000,"/data/gifOctober/roottrees/")'
```
### How do I run analysis code ? 

Let's say you want to analyse HV point 5 , Scan ID 508 and with 5000 Max Trigger:

```
cd /home/acqcmsmu/FEB_DAQ/Analysis/AnalysisiRPC/
source init.sh
root -l 'run_ana_FEBv2.C(5,508,5000,"/data/gifOctober/roottrees/")'
```

### How do I obtain efficiency curves ? 
Everytime, you run the 'run_ana_FEBv2.C' you will obtain a txt file in outputs directory.  

The script called dreff.py is taking Scan ID and working point arguments to read these files correctly plus the directory for on/out muon window and the HV points (from google sheets).  
You need to provide as a first argument the Scan ID, second the working point, third the directory for on/out muon window  and all HV points.  
Working point can be Loose, Medium, Tight. 
 
For example, for ScanId 508, on muon window, and Medium working point:
```
python dreff.py 508 Medium on_muon_window 6 6.5 6.9 7 7.1 7.2 7.5
```
Run again for out muon window:
```
python dreff.py 508 Medium out_muon_window 6 6.5 6.9 7 7.1 7.2 7.5
```
And finally, the macro that produces the S curve:
```
root -l -b -q 'eff_curve.C(508,"Medium")'
```

```
cd /home/acqcmsmu/FEB_DAQ/Analysis/AnalysisiRPC/
source init.sh
python3 dreff.py 508 Loose
```
